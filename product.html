                        <br />
                        Custom crafted for you with
                        <b>a heavy duty and long-lasting</b> design, the
                        Leatherette is an excellent choice for the everyday
                        vehicle. These leather-like seat covers are ideal for
                        those who want the look of leather but not the hot,
                        restrictive feel. <br />
                        <br />
                        Made with waterproof material, we’ll create your covers
                        to match the interior of your car or in a bold, unique
                        color. Whether you’re taking the kids to school or
                        taking a road trip, Leatherette is made from a
                        high-grade vinyl that’s highly resistant to stains and
                        tears, ensuring that your vehicle’s interior will be
                        protected along the way.
